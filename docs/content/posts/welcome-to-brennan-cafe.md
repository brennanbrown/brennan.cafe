# Welcome to brennan.cafe! 🌻

I'm excited to launch my new homelab project! This is the beginning of my journey to build a more ethical, privacy-respecting digital infrastructure.

## What is brennan.cafe?

brennan.cafe is my personal homelab running on a 2011 ThinkPad W520. It's a practical exploration of:
- **De-Googling**: Replacing corporate cloud services with self-hosted alternatives
- **Privacy**: Building systems that respect user privacy
- **Learning**: Hands-on experience with backend/server administration
- **Ethics**: FOSS only, no surveillance, no tracking

## The Stack

- **Hardware**: ThinkPad W520 (Intel i7, 12GB RAM)
- **OS**: Lubuntu 24.04.3 LTS
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Reverse Proxy**: Caddy 2
- **Tunnel**: Cloudflare Tunnel

## Services

1. **Static Site** (brennan.cafe) - Hugo blog & docs
2. **File Storage** (files.brennan.cafe) - Nextcloud
3. **Media Server** (media.brennan.cafe) - Jellyfin
4. **Collaborative Notes** (notes.brennan.cafe) - HedgeDoc
5. **Status Monitoring** (status.brennan.cafe) - Uptime Kuma
6. **Analytics** (analytics.brennan.cafe) - Plausible

## Why This Matters

In an age of surveillance capitalism, taking control of our digital infrastructure is an act of resistance. By self-hosting, we:
- Own our data
- Protect our privacy
- Learn valuable skills
- Reduce dependence on corporate services
- Build a more ethical internet

## What's Next?

I'll be documenting my journey here, including:
- Setup tutorials and troubleshooting guides
- Thoughts on privacy and digital sovereignty
- Performance optimization for old hardware
- IndieWeb implementation details

Stay tuned for more posts!
